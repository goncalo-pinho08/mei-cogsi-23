# Configuration and Management of Systems
ISEP - Masters Degree in Software Engennering - Computional Systems - 2023

Welcome to the Configuration and Management of Systems repository, which houses my complete master's degree project on COGSI (Configuration and Management of Systems). It is important to note that these projects were executed on a MacBook M1, so there may be variations if you are using a non-ARM architecture.

There are a total of five interdependent projects in this repository:

P1 - Monitoring Networks and Systems:
This project involved utilizing Vagrant to provide virtual machines (VMs) and employing Nagios with NRPE to monitor a Tomcat 9 server.

P2 - Application Monitoring:
In this project, the focus was on using JMX to monitor a Java application and employing JMX to monitor Tomcat as well. Additionally, we were expected to utilize NSCA for passive checks.

P3 - Virtualization and Containers:
Building upon the previous projects, this endeavor aimed to implement P1 and P2 using Docker for virtualization and containerization.

P4 - Network and System Simulation:
For this project, the objective was to simulate a network and monitor various components using GNS3. However, please note that GNS3 does not support ARM architectures so I had to implement a variant of this.

P5 - Integration:
In this final project, our goal was to implement the complete DevOps cycle by adopting the concept of infrastructure as code. I aimed to automate processes as much as possible using Ansible.

Please explore the relevant project folders for detailed information and resources related to each project.
